        <p>
          Suely is originally from Fortaleza, Brazil and now lives in Redmond, Washington. 
          When she is not coding or solving puzzles, she enjoys walking on trails, and listening to music.
          Her favorite bands are Coldplay, U2, Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, and Mumford & Sons.
        </p> 
        
        <p>Suely loves Brazilian coffee and used to harvest Arabica beans in the Maciço do Baturité, Ceará, to brew her own coffee.
           She didn’t use any machines in the process, just her hands, to obtain high quality beans with minimum environmental impact.
