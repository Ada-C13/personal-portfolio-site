<h2 class="subtitle">Women's Self Defense Certification</h2>

<div align="center"><img width="400" height="400" src="./pics/wsd.png"></div>

<p class="tab">I believe that knowing self defense is an important aspect and right for everyone- to protect one's self and our loved ones. In receiving certification, I co-instruct in monthly classes teaching women defense against knives, guns, and ground attacks.</p1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Green Beauty</h2>

<div align="center"><img width="400" height="400" src="./pics/greenbeauty.png"></div>

<p class="tab">Natural beauty became important when I garnered an understanding of how products were tested on animals. I want to leave a better world for my children and the first step was to become more conscientious about everyday products. This led me to start a personal website exploring the best of what the natural beauty community had to offer. As a result, I collaborated with several brands and gathered a community of 2500 women connected over social media.</p1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Running</h2>

<div align="center"><img width="400" height="400" src="./pics/charityrun.png" alt="Charity Run"></div>

<p class="tab">Nothing is better than running for a charitable cause alongside a good friend. It has been an honor to complete races benefiting breast cancer and heart health research and building homes in the Philippines.</p1>

<div><p class="tab">Being a Managing Editor for a green beauty editorial, I had an opportunity to bring a focus on mental health and inner beauty that was missing from the conventional beauty world. We can all find the right foundation and lipstick to enhance our natural beauty. It is what is inside that shines so much stronger.</p1></div>

<div><p class="tab">I have found that supporting other women in their parenting journey is the greatest gift you can give anyone. Speaking candidly and empathetically about the experience can be of tremendous help to those who are struggling with the constant social imagery of perfection. This is my letter to other moms.</p1></div>
