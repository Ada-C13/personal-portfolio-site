      <p>This is a great slow cooker recipe by Angel Wong. If you're running short on time, you can also cook over the stove or using an Instant Pot. Stores wonderfully in the freezer, so you can save some for a quick meal later.</p>

      <p>Three cup chicken is a very iconic Taiwanese dish. Angel Wong dymystifies the traditional recipe in her take on this classic. Make sure you keep an eye on the cooking time and remember to stir - due to the high amount of soy sauce, the chicken may burn if you're not paying attention!</p>
      <p>If you're cooking for people who are adverse to cooking wine, lemon juice can be used as a substituted. However, be aware that such a substitution will result in a less glossy shine and may burn more easily.</p>

      <p>Pan-fried tofu is a staple of most Taiwanese households, which each family having their own way of preparing it. Angel Wong provides a tasty vegetarian option with her miso and ginger sauce recipe. When trying it out, make sure to not prepare the green onion garnish too early in advance or else they will soften and lose their fresh taste.</p>
      <p>Another common alternative sauce is to use BBQ Satay Sauce. This can be an even quicker recipe since you won't have to mix the sauce or mince the ginger.</p>

        <li>Clean as you go</li>
        <li>Always taste your food before seasoning</li>
        <li>Never overcrowd your skillet with food - the heat will not distribute evenly</li>
