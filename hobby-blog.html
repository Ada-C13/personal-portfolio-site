          <h3>Trees & Plants</h3>
          <p>I have loved being among trees and plants for as long as I ermemebr, but my interest peaked after taking a horticulture class while in grad school. Now I love everything from identifying trees to vegtable gardening and everthing in between.</p>

          <h3>Nature</h3>
          <p>Nothing refreshes my soul like taking a hike and observing the nature. It helps me reflect and adjusts my perspective. I gain calmness when I am in the natural world and feel as part of a greater system. can you hear the sound of the weaving leaves and the birds when you close your eyes?</p>

          <h3>Running</h3>
          <p>For the longes time I watched those who were running outside and thaught of them as "them" vs. me. I never thaugh I could run like they did specially that I would have trouble breathing even after 2 minutes of running. Eventually one day with the help of an app I startel running and slowly but surely I got better! Now I would not miss anything for my Saturday morning runs. They helps me stay focused and reset me for the week ahead.</p>

          <h3>Learning</h3>
          <p>I Love Learning! There are so many things that excite me since they bring me new knowledge from podcast to magazines and internet searches and everything in between, But I have to admit, books are still my favourite media, becuase not only they can teach me thing beyond my imagination, they have the ability of transforming me into another character and transporting me to faraway lands and faraway times....oh what a pleasure!</p>
