                <p>09.01.2019 The .each method seems too good to be true, in other languages generally you would have to deal with 'for' loops if you want to iterate through a list of things. In ruby it is just .each in front of the thing you want to loop through. WOW! makes sense!</p>
                <p>09.05.2019 The concept of object oriented programming was quite new to me and I was still grasping the concept of classes and objects, what were the difference between them and I just ignored understanding any of this until I hit a road block. The road block is now, when I eventually have to define my own classes and use them in my project.</p>
                <p>09.10.2019 Puts is a very popular method for outputting values of variables or any kind of state in the app, however this sometimes leads to a lot of confusion. If I had taken the time I would have known that 'p' was the better method call to use if I want to preserve the data type.</p>
