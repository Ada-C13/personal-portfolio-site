      <h2>Spring Break</h2>
      <time datetime="2020-03-20"> Mar 20, 2020</time>
      <p>Spring break week officialy kicks off from tomorrow. We still have around 7 assignments to complete during this time. Yes! I counted how many assignments we have! üò≠ I have lots of subjects on my mind that I wanted to study by myself. Due to all of this homework, I'm not sure I can get around to it, but I will do my best to get as much done as possible while still managing to take a rest! üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èYoga time!</p>

      <h2>Online class began</h2>
      <time datetime="2020-03-12"> Mar 12, 2020</time>
      <p>Covid-19 has finally hit the US. For everyone's health and safety, our classes were moved from onsite to online starting Mar 10, 2020. I won't lie! I enjoyed taking a class in my PJs at first, but I really miss having classes onsite and interacting with my dear friends. At least we have an accountablity group to keep us from feeling too isolated at home during our code journey. This is a scary time for everyone for sure, but I believe that it could be a valuable experience for instructors, staff and students. We can learn something valuable even from this unusual time. For example, we can learn how to create a more robust online education program for future Adies, and build strong support groups virtually (peers to peers, tutors to students, instructors to students). Furthermore, we have a chance to spend more time with our families. Positive mental attitude! That said, I still miss everyone.</p>

      <h2>Time flies</h2>
      <time datetime="2020-02-28"> Feb 28, 2020</time>
      <p>It's been a month already since I started school at Ada. Everyone is so passionate about learning and eager to ask questions, share ideas, and support one another. Although I don't have much time to sleep these days due to my studies -- we have tons of daily assignments and weekly projects -- it's been such an incredible time. I've already created content for a variety of projects like Adagram, ride share, solar system, grocery store order tracking, hotel reservation maker, etc. Also, I really enjoy working on pair projects, and I now realize the benefit of having a second pair of eyes! üôè I can't wait to work on and give my own spin to our upcoming projects!!!</p>

      <h2>Got Accepted to Ada!!!</h2>
      <time datetime="2019-11-25"> Nov 25, 2019</time>
      <p>News flash!! One of my resolutions for 2019 came true! I got accepted into Ada. It was one of the happiest days of my life. üòÑ I literally jumped around the house to celebrate the moment. I passed 3 phases of the application process. Since it took around 3 months, it felt like an extremely long journey to prepare and pass each step (resume/essay/data analysis/coding challenge/technical interview/final intervew), but in the end I can say it was all worth the effort. I'm so proud of myself that I had the grit and motivation to succeed. Plus, I'm thankful for all the people who believe in me. My coding journey will officially begin from next year. I'm going to enjoy this moment before the next phase of my whirlwind journey begins.</p>
