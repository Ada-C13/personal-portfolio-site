      <h2>March</h2>

        <h4>3.13.20</h4>
          <p>Friday the 13th! I consider 13 to be one of my lucky numbers, but today wasn't just any other day. I cancelled my flight to San Francisco. Okay, more like forced to. I'm disappointed of course, but I tell myself this is temporary, it's a moment I (we) have to weather through. I'm grateful to be with family during this time of uncertainty.  </p> 

        <h4>3.11.20</h4>
          <p>First week of online classes at ADA is in the books. I miss seeing my classmates and instructors. Grateful to my classmates who've reached out.</p>

        <h4>3.1.20</h4>
          <p>Happy Women's History Month! Endless gratitude to the women who paved the path; Elizabeth Blackwell, M.D., Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie, the women who marched on 3.3.1913, Katherine Graham, Katherine Johnson, Grace Hopper, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama. The list is endless. But I'm saying a special thank you to my mom, who stood her ground and powered through as a single parent. </p>

        <h2>February</h2>
        <h4>2.17.20</h4>
          <p>With the current state of the world (thanks, COVID-19) it's important to take care of yourself. Grateful for the PNW and its abundant nature trails. </p> 

        <h4>2.10.20</h4>
          <p>In the past, if my day went south, I'd silently wish for a do-over. As I try to practice with a new mindset. I now ask, what can I do differently tomorrow? Or the next time I have a day like this? I'm grateful for having the opportunity to grow from my mistakes.</p> 

        <h4>2.3.20</h4>
          <p>First day of Ada! My mind is racing all over with all the overwhelming information. I'm grateful to start this journey with people who have good intentions, who genuinely want you to succeed. </p> 

        <h2>January</h2>

        <h4>1.25.20</h4>
          <p>Lots of tears, two gas/food pit-stops, and a failed attempt to visit an In-N-Out in Oregon; and I'm officially a Seattle resident (ok, Bellevue but close enough). Grateful and blessed to have an older brother who flew down to S.F. yesterday to accompany me on my drive up.</p> 

        <h4>1.24.20</h4>
          <p>A week full of goodbyes. Thankful for a family dinner (over KBBQ, of course!). Pretty sure we won't be having one until June, when Nathan graduates.</p> 

        <h4>1.1.20</h4>
          <p>Happy New Year! While taking apart my 2019 vision board, I'm brought to tears as I look at what I accomplished and what humbled me. Grateful for another year of growth.</p>
