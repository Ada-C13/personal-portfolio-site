                    <p>08.20.2019 Ruby is a dynamic, high-level, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</p>
                    <p>08.21.2019 Yukihiro Matsumoto blended parts of his favourite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming. It has gained popularity for its use in web application development using the Ruby on Rails framework, built with the Ruby language by David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>
                    <p>08.25.2019 The standard Ruby library includes extensions for a wide variety of projects and tasks: database management, networking, specialized mathematics, XML processing, and many more. Libraries in ruby that contain a specific piece of functionality as well as any files or assets related to that functionality are often packaged in gems.</p>
