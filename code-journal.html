    <h2>Life before Ada</h2>
    <p>My interest got sparked when I was working in Accounting field. To challenge myself, I always volunteered to dive into any technical problems that happened to my team. First, I couldn’t imagine how powerful the programming is, but when I realized programming helps scale the business more efficiently, I started to focus more on programming languages. Also inspired and strongly recommended by many of my close friends who work in IT field, I decided to take some free online SQL, programming, HTML, Java, and R courses. I took SQL course because I saw my manager was using it as part of her task – extracting and analyzing data – and I want to do that as well. Once I felt confident with my SQL skills, I voluntarily helped my manager with any related SQL tasks, data manipulation, and reporting. I had invested time into learning and improving my Advanced SQL skills by building a tool utilizing SQL on R via connection string, Stored Procedure, Trigger, CTE, and View which could be used to analyze data more effectively and efficiently. Besides finding programming fun and exciting, what I love most about programming is solving technical problems, debugging, looping, building algorithm/logic, and designing layout. </p>

      <h2>Why Ada?</h2>
      <p>Because I have a strong passion for technology and desire for career change, coupled with my background that fits Ada’s mission and vision. I would be a great fit for this program since I like learning programming languages, solving technical issues, working on software developments, and collaborating with software developers from various backgrounds. While working so diligently on changing my career from Accounting to IT field, I found it is very rewarding and fulfilling; that is, when I got my first IT job as an IT Business Analyst, I have worked on software developments where the applications are being used to run the business more effectively and efficiently. I am very inspired by Ada’s mission and vision that promote gender diversity by providing women the opportunities to develop their skills and preparing them to become professional software developers. As a poor female immigrant who came to America to pursue a better life, I really want to be part of Ada, not only to earn technical skills, fulfill my desire in technology and reach my eventual career goal, but also to prove the world that a female immigrant is capable of solving complicated technical issues and becomes a successful software developer.</p>

    <h2>Difficult Aspect of Programming</h2>
    <p>The most difficult aspect of programming is understanding the logic and how to make it work as the way it should be. I also have some challenges with terminology since I do not have IT background. However, I have overcome it by reading IT articles, doing more researches, and keeping practicing. With a can-do and never-give-up attitude, I always keep myself motivated by optimistically believing that every problem has its own solutions and I will find ways to tackle it. When dealing with difficult or frustrating concepts, I trust my self-motivation, confidence, and abilities to utilize all available resources. I used to have some challenges dealing with difficult logic for a few days. First, I felt frustrated and discouraged, but after taking a short break and then approached that problem with fresh eyes and different perspectives along with some guidance from available resources, I was able to break down the problem into smaller solvable pieces and tackle it step by step. I always treat difficult tasks as fun and exciting because I positively think of all probable solutions. Another important motivation for me is my strong passion in programming which will allow me to utilize my creativity and analytical skills.</p>

    <h2>Career Plan in the Next Five Years</h2>
    <p>In the next five years, I see myself as one of the successful experienced female Software Developers with a high-tech company where I can utilize my technical skills and experiences. I will leverage the experience and skills that I gained through Ada program to support future underrepresented developers by encouraging family members, friends, gender diverse people; and especially, women to step into the IT industry. I will join Ada Community and Ada’s volunteer network and am willing to offer my time and experiences for mentorship, teaching assistantship, and other forms of help for next cohorts. With my background and experience in Accounting, I am sure that there are many people out there who are hesitant and struggling with career change. If I am given an opportunity to be in Ada program and become a software developer, I would love to continue to share all my experiences and become a mentor for future Ada students. I would love to see other gender diverse people/students and women in particular to be successful in the IT industry as I would be. I will continue to encourage other women to dare to challenge themselves and have a courage to become a software developer or work in IT field if they think they set feet in the wrong field and hesitated to step into the IT field because they think technology is too hard for women. I will show the world that a female immigrant without IT background can be a successful software developer.</p>
