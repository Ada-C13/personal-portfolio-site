        <p>Hello! My name is Lee (they/them) and I'm a software development student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. 
        <p>My interest in programming was first sparked in 2001, when I created my first website with code written in Notepad, graphics made in MS Paint, and free images curated through Google Search. It was rough around the edges, but one of the funnest projects of my life!</p> 
        <p>What I love most about programming — the aspect that keeps pulling me back — is the ability to create something large and complex using the simplest components. Although my journey has routed through linguistics, comics creation, writing, copy editing, and tour planning, all of these interests have that aspect in common. Even with minimal resources, programming allows us to contribute to something grander than a few lines of code.</p>
