            <h5>Hi! I'm Olga, and I'm a beginner programmer. While coding I make mistakes and learn from each and every one of them. Here I keep some quotes to make me and anyone reading this aware of mistakes programmers make while creating their code. It's also a good reminder for me to avoid them.</h5>
