        <p>Being a software developer has been my dream occupation and I have been preparing myself for it.  I learned about your program from Leah Petersen’s blog where she shared her life-changing experiences at Ada Developer Academy.  As a lesbian Asian immigrant, I relate deeply to Ada Developer Academy’s message of gender diversity and advocacy for women.</p>

        <p>Currently, I work as a Project Coordinator at a startup company. Working alongside developers, I discovered my interest in programming. I began exploring technical terms that led to self-learning Markdown, HTML, CSS, command-line, and software version control tools such as git. To further practice what I've learned, I used Hugo, an open-source site generator to create a user guide in Markdown for our company's main product. Besides learning, I also tried ways to get involved in the open-source community. For example, I helped improve the Chinese translation of FreeCodeCamp materials at the Hacktoberfest event. My learning journey never stops. I am currently learning Ruby and MySQL through online resources to explore both front-end and back-end languages to catch up with the world trend.</p>
        
        <p>My short-term goal is to solidify my programming skills, create fun projects, and complete my portfolio. My mid-term goal is to become a full-time software developer. Lastly, I want to be able to inspire women in coding and reinforce the power of women and gender diversity in the Tech Industry. Thank you for your time and consideration; I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
