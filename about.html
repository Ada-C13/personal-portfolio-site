        <h2>About Me</h2>  
          <p>I was born and raised in Eritrea, East Africa. I graduated from the only university in my country , Asmara University with a major in English and minor in Education and became a high school English Teacher after graduation. During my time as a teacher in a small rural town, the children I taught had little to exposure to English. Technology was almost non-exisitent and they had to work harder to achieve what the students in the capital  City lived had. But despite all the challenges of life and hardship, they showed up every morning eager to learn. And I loved being a part of the few teachers they had in bringing them the knowledge they deserve. </p> 
          <p>As I venture into my new career path of technology, my hope and dream is fro me to be able to be in a position to bring the necessary and basic accessibility to the Tech world to these kind children. </p>

        <h2>Home Town</h2>
          <p>The city I grew up in is called Asmara.It's known for its Italian colonial buildings, like the Catholic Cathedral. The city's eclectic architecture ranges from art deco cinemas to the Futurist, airplane-shaped Fiat Tagliero service station. The grand former governor's palace dates from the 19th century. Close by is the ornate Opera House, built in the early 1900s in a mix of styles.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>I have always been drawn to Organizations who care for the well being of those less fortunate. Being a kind and giving person is what I consider most important in life. As so, my interests and passion lies along these axis lines.</p> 
          <p>Volunteering  is one of the first things I participated in when I moved to the US. I was a full time volunteer at the American Red Cross and the University of Washington Medical Center. I was able to help Immigrants and Refugees by being an interpreter and translator as they navigating their new lives.</p> 
          <p>Being part of Ada’s movement in empowering women and gender-diverse people, is my utmost pride and joy at the moment.
            I’m very fortunate to be in an environment where my passion and interest are in line with others like myself.</p>
