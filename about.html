            <h5>Hi! I'm Olga, and I'm a beginner programmer. While coding I make mistakes and learn from each and every one of them. Here I store some quotes to make me aware of mistakes programmers make while creating their code. It's also a good reminder to avoid them.</h5>

            <q>When reviewing code, count to 10 before you refactor a line. If the code does not have tests, a hundred.</q>
            <q>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live..</q>
            <q>Using double negatives is just very not not wrong.</q>
            <q>Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight..</q>
            <q>There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies..</q>
            <q>Do not be attached to code because of how much effort you put into it. Bad code needs to be discarded.</q>
            <q>The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you are doing.</q>
            <q>It is not a bug. It is a feature.</q>
            <q>Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.</q>
            <q>Take a lot of short breaks. Leave your chair and take a short walk and use it to think about what you need to do next. Come back to the code with fresh eyes.</q>
