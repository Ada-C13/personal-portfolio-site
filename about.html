          <p>Nora (she/her) built her first webpage in notepad in the mid 90's. She was immediately captivated that she could build something that was instantly available for people all over the world. While she started her undergraduate at Western Washington University as a Computer Science major, within a year she switched to focus on Marketing, but never left the world of tech. Since then she's gone on to get her Master's degree of Communication in Digital Media from the University of Washington. Her career has included roles focusing on copywriting, content strategy, social media marketing, and UX writing at companies including Microsoft, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Amazon, the University of Washington, and RealSelf. Throughout all of those roles she's always had a focus on finding out what the user or customer needed and working to align business goals with customer needs.</p>

          <p>Though she built most of her career to-date working with words, she's never let go of her love of creating with technology. She loves learning new skills, problem solving, and does logic puzzles for fun. She's passionate about helping build others' skills and has experience both as a manager and a teacher. She's dedicated and will dig into any challenge presented to her.</p>
