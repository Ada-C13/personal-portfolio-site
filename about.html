    <h2>Hi! I'm Stephanie</h2>
    <p>I worked in the airline industry for 13 years, 
      my experience as a Loadmaster in Operations also includes Project Management, Training Development, and Classroom Instruction.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning software development at Ada Developers Academy</p>
    <p>I am a California native and enjoy all things sunshine and water. I am excited to represent Native American Women in tech.</p>
    <p>I have a senior beagle named June, which has led me to living a cruelty free lifestyle. 
      Did you know, unless you have made conscious decisions not to, your kitchen and bathroom are probably full of products
      tested on animals? Beagles are used for animal testing because of their docile and forgiving nature.</p>
    <p>I consider myself a creative person, I love all things art and design. I am hoping to bring my creative side to wherever I end up in the tech world!</p>
