      <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Photography is my outlet to express my creative side. I've experimented with other types of photography, but I seem to always come back to taking nature pictures.</p>

        <p>I believe in and practice shinrin-yoku, which translates to forest bathing; a practice originating in Japan. Its practice encourages you to bath or take in nature with our senses;  sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite artists in Kai. His paintings feature a person named "I.F" who also happens to be nonbinary. Kai paints "I.F" to cultivate communication across different cultures, pertaining to love, money, and happiness.</p>
