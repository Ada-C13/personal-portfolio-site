      <h2 class="title">PROBLEM SOLVING AND LOGIC SKILLS</h2>
      <p>
        At ADA I have been developing the skill of solving problems and thinking
        logically. I try to remind myself it is not about what I am doing, but
        HOW I am doing it. It is important to break down the problem and create
        a habit of asking as many questions as possible to clarify a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find motivation in my goal of becoming a developer when I find myself
        using my solving problems skill in my daily tasks. Making decisions was
        not my strongest skill, I could be stuck in a loop, trying to come up
        with solutions for simple problems, such as planning my day. Since I
        started the ADA program my mindset changed and I am able to evaluate my
        plan, exploring the options and making a decision with confidence and
        knowing there are lots of ways to solve a problem.
