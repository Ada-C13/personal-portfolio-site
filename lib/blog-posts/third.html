      <h2 class="title">BEING PART OF ADA</h2>
      <p>
        I heard about ADA in 2017 when I was nannying and applying for my green
        card. My husband is a UX developer and he has met addies that are
        developers in the tech company he works for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never in my life imagined I would be able to learn how to code. The
        ADA mission of inclusivity aligns with my beliefs and that made me feel
        confident to dream about being part of the tech world and hopefully use
        my skills to make a more diverse community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I applied twice before being accepted. My experience at ADA has been
        beyond what I imagined. ADA really cares about their mission and
        students. I feel included, happy and empowered.
