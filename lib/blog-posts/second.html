      <h2 class="title">PAIR PROGRAMMING</h2>
      <p>
        Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two
        programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes
        code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of
        code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        At ADA we pair program every other week. We usually have afternoons for
        project time. Getting the chance to see someone else coding while you
        think about their decisions, watching out for potencial bugs and being
        actively engaging with the task throughout a paired session.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">BENEFITS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We program out loud reducing the risk of error and bugs.</li>
        <li>Sharing knowledge among the pair</li>
        <li>Keep both focused in the task</li>
      </ul>
