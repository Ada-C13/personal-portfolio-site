      <h2 class="title">LANGUAGE BARRIERS</h2>
      <p>
        As a brazilian, my first language is portuguese. I moved to the United
        States to learn english while experiencing American culture as an Au
        Pair. Since I started ADA I face the challenge of trying to learn new
        concepts every day in a language I still donâ€™t master.
      </p>
      <p>
        When reading assignments, instructions for activities or even talking
        with the students about new material, I need to have a lot of focus and
        sometimes, I have to ask a student or search on google the meaning of
        the new concept to make sure I am understanding it correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is comforting to be surrounded by foreign students that also struggle
        just like me, I am not alone. We learn with one another and we are
        encouraged to ask the instructors when a new concept needs more
        clarification. Being exposed to coding and english 7 days a week has
        been a great experience and I see improvements every day.
