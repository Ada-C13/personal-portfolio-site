            <p>Rideshare Programs are systems that help people organize carpooling/vanpooling. Some popular on-demand rideshare apps, like Lyft and Uber, store and use data on riders, drivers, and trips, particularly data on when a trip happened, who was the driver, and who was the rider. This project models a simple version of this system using object-oriented programming.</p>

            <p>An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. Adagrams is a fictional game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Adagrams has a specific scoring system, so that the player's submitted anagram scores points. The rules for Adagrams are roughly inspired by the "Letter Round" portion of the British game show Countdown.</p>
