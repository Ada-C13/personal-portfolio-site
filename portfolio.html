<h2>PROFESSIONAL ARTICLES</h2>

[Why I Love Coffee](https://katemyer.com/why-i-love-coffee/) | What is life without coffee? It brings people together, it calms the soul, and energizes the spirit. This is my ode to coffee.

[Sense of Worth](https://katemyer.com/sense-of-worth/) | Being a Managing Editor for a green beauty editorial, I had an opportunity to bring a focus on mental health and inner beauty that was missing from the conventional beauty world. We can all find the right foundation and lipstick to enhance our natural beauty. It is what is inside that shines so much stronger.

[Dear Mommy Friend](https://katemyer.com/dear-mommy-friend/) | I have found that supporting other women in their parenting journey is the greatest gift you can give anyone. Speaking candidly and empathetically about the experience can be of tremendous help to those who are struggling with the constant social imagery of perfection. This is my letter to other moms.
