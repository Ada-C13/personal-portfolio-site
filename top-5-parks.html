          <h2>Discovery Park</h2>
        
          <p>Discovery park is the number one park in Seattle!  It has a beach, grasslands, forest, endless miles of trails, and amazing birdwatching.  It is the largest park in Seattle!  The United Indians of All Tribes' Daybreak Star Cultural Center is located here. Pack a picnic and eat on the grassy fields overlooking Puget Sound with a view of the Olympics.  A more perfect day could not be found.</p>

            <h2>Seward Park</h2>
            
            <p>Seward Park is a great place for walking, running, and biking along the wide paved loop trail.  The park is situated on the Bailey Peninsula which contains about 200 acres of forest. There are many guided bird walks at Seward Park to enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Washington Arboretum</h2>
            
            <p>The Arboretum is managed by the University of Washington, and it is an amazing place to go for a quiet walk on a cloudy day.  This park has a collection of a wide variety of trees which are used by UW students for research and forestry practice.  It is a small but mighty park and is well worth a stroll.</p>

            <h2>Lincoln Park</h2>
            
            <p>Lincoln Park is located on the shores of Puget Sound in West Seattle.  Directly next to the Fauntleroy Ferry dock, this park also houses the Coleman Pool - Seattle's only outdoor saltwater pool!  It has miles of trails, an amazing playground, and a huge picnic area.  There is beach access, and people have been known to see whales spouting in the sound!</p>

            <h2>Carkeek Park</h2>
            
            <p>Carkeek has everything!  A beach, trains, a rickety bridge you can walk over and see the trains pass underneath you, trails, a creek, and a yearly 12 hour trail race!  You can also see the salmon run during spawning season.  This is a great place for a varied stroll amongst the evergreens.  Often times Seattle's own Bubbleman is in the park entertaining the kids!</p>
