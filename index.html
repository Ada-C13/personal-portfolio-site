        <h1>Hi! I'm Haben</h1>
        <p>A student at Ada Developers Acadamey</p>

        <h2>Life at Ada</h2>
        <p>If I was asked what I would be doing in five years, five years ago, I wouldnâ€™t have said to be a Software
          Developer for sure.
          Not that we all know what we would be doing in a couple of years, but we can have some assumptions or vision.
          But, then Ada changed everything for me. I have always seen myself work in the non-profit world and shifting
          to the tech side seemed for me, leaving that behind. But now, not really. One of things that made me decide to
          take a leap of faith into even attempting to change a career path was what Ada stood for. It made me envision
          myself to be what I wanted to be and still hold on to my life long values.To be with people from all walks of
          life and background, caring for each other , is what I will remember my time at Ada. For this, I will always
          be thankful. And my hope and plan is to pay it forward.
