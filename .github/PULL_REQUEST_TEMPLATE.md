## Comprehension Questions

:------------- | :-------------
Did you have to resolve any issues when running the HTML Validator? If so, what were they? | It was mostly about "section" part. From the HTML validator, I learn that I should add identifying headings to all sections. For a minor issue, it showed me a symantic error for `<footer>` tag as I accidentaly added `<footer>` open tag twice in a row.
Why is it important to consider and use semantic HTML? | Having semantic HTML means I can create higher quality content that attracts more visitors. Proper semantics also helps to increase accessibility, as assisted technologies such as screen readers can better interpret the meaning of content.
How did you decide to structure your CSS? | I decided to make several CSS files per html page. This helped me not to worry about CSS precedence much and distinguish styles per page, making it easy to refactor them in the future.
What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? | It was challenging for me to make responsive webpages, particularly concerning the `portfolio` page as it contains multiple of images with different sizes.
Describe one area that you gained more clarity on when completing this assignment | I have a better understanding of when to use `grid` and `felx box`.
