## Comprehension Questions
Question | Answer
:------------- | :-------------
Did you have to resolve any issues when running the HTML Validator? If so, what were they? | Yes, they were all syntax related issues such as adding an ending tag or just updating the way css should be written. Can't believe that it's changed that much in just 2 years!|
Why is it important to consider and use semantic HTML? | It really helped to keep everything organized. For my project, I had lots of titles, subtitles, bullets, and subbullets. Semantic HTML uses classes to keep it all organized especially when sections get broken down in very specific parts. |
How did you decide to structure your CSS? | I used an external css file that I referenced in my html files. I started off broadly like what how I wanted the general main body to look, then I started narrowing it down based on a resume format on section titles, sub titles, bullets, subbullets. I also included headers and footers. I made all these little sections classes which I was able to use when I started making my "containers" indicated by <div> |
What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? | Figuring out a design, color palette, and then getting it to look the way I wanted! This was a super enjoyable fun project that I loved getting lost in. I loved seeing how things could change instantly the second I changed a value to a propery. Honestly, this has been my favorite project by far that I will revisit in days to come. | 
Describe one area that you gained more clarity on when completing this assignment | Just like any project, it was important to draw out what I wanted to get an idea of how I wanted things to look and where I wanted things to be placed. From there, I was able to use classes to organize certain parts into the way I needed it to look. If anything, using the skills from other Ruby projects helped this one play out a lot smoother. Never start coding first, always write it out first on paper and go from there is the key thing I took away with this project. |
**Optional** |
Did you deploy to GitHub Pages? If so, what is the URL to your website? | https://github.com/katemyer/katemyer.github.io |
