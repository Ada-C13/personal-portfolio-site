      <h2>My hobby is traveling</h2>
      <p>
        My hobby is traveling. One of my favorite places is Hawaii. I've been to three islands so far: Oahu, Big Island and Maui. Each island is amazing has something unique. Oahu with its capital Honolulu is famous for the Diamond Head volcano and Waikiki beach. One of the main attractions of the Big Island (also known as Hawaii island) is the Kilauea volcano and black sand beaches. I think the business card of Hawaii islands are the beaches and below are some of them :)

      <h2>Lanikai Beach, Oahu</h2>
      <p>
        Lanikai Beach is located in Lanikai, a community in the town of Kailua and on the windward coast of Oahu, Hawaii. Lanikai Beach has two Islands in the background called the Na Mokulua or "mokes". Kayakers will often row out to land on the larger northern island, but no one is allowed to land on the southern island as it is a bird sanctuary. Water temperatures are generally 75–80 °F (24–26 °C). Lanikai Beach is regularly voted as one of the best beaches in America and is the only beach in the USA that was voted as one of the best beaches in the world.

      <p>
        Maui’s famous black sand beach, named Honokalani and located in Waianapanapa State Park is about three miles north of the town of Hana.  It was historically a very important place for Hawaiians, and there are various Hawaiian legends about this place – it is deemed as sacred by the Hawaiian people.

      <h2>Big Island</h2>
      <p>
        The Big Island is the largest and most volcanically active of all Hawaiian islands. The Big Island is officially known as the island of Hawaii and received this nickname for a good reason: it is the largest island of the United States with a total surface of 4,029 square miles (10,433 square kilometers)! Its surface area is also greater than that of all other Hawaiian island combined.
