        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>To mention two out of my many hobbies:</p>
        <h3>Literature</h3>
        <p>I was introduced to the habit of reading by going the British Library back home in Eritrea when I was in
          Elementary School. I was quickly drawn to the African and British literature and there was an abundance of them. Reading like “A Tale of Two Cities” and
          “Great Expectations” by Charles Dickens was my favorite weekend past time. And it was then that I was
         fell in love with some of the greatest African Literature writers such as Chinuwa Achebe and his famous book
          “Things Fall Apart “ which taught me about colonialism and its aftermath in the late nineteenth century.
          Then, after joining the English Department at the University , I was able to broaden my knowledge to variety
          of literature creations.
          To mention one of my favorite modern authors at the moment is another Nigerian author- Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and one of her many
          outstanding novels based on true events in her country, is  her book titled “Half of a Yellow Sun”.</p>
